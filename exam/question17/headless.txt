n namespace dns-lab , create a busybox:1.36 pod named dns-client that sleeps so you can run interactive commands.
Deploy an nginx:1.25 service named web in namespace web (create the namespace if needed) and expose it with a ClusterIP service on port 80.
From the dns-client pod, resolve:
The short service name web (should only work with web.dns-lab.svc.cluster.local or when in the same namespace).
The fully qualified domain name web.web.svc.cluster.local .
The headless service DNS entry after converting the service to headless mode.
Record the commands and resulting DNS lookups.
