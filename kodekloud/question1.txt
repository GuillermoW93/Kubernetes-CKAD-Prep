Add a taint to the node node01 of the cluster. Use the specification below:
key: app_type, value: alpha and effect: NoSchedule

Create a pod called alpha, image: redis with toleration to node01.

To add a taint to the node node01 using the imperative command:-

kubectl taint node node01 app_type=alpha:NoSchedule

Verify it using the kubectl describe command:-

root@controlplane:~$ kubectl describe node node01 | grep -i app_type

Now, create a pod manifest file called alpha using the imperative command:-

kubectl run alpha --image=redis --dry-run=client -oyaml > alpha.yaml

and add rules under the spec.tolerations field as follows:

tolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: app_type
    value: alpha

So final manifest file to create a pod called alpha with tolerations rules as follows:-

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: alpha
  name: alpha
spec:
  tolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: app_type
    value: alpha
  containers:
  - image: redis
    name: alpha
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always

To check the pod has been successfully deployed on the node node01, using -o wide flag:-

kubectl get pods -o wide
